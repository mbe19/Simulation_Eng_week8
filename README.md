# Simulation Engineering Week 8 Solution

This is a proposed solution for the week 8 exercise sheet, in the /src directory the source code written in python can be found, /animation\_outpout includes a video demonstrating the output of the algorithm.

For the animation we are using the handy [```pygame```](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) package.

## Usage

simply clone the repository. Then follow this:

```
pip3 install pygame

cd src/

python Visualization_simple_pendulum.py

```
